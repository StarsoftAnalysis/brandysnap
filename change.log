0.1.3 
 * no snapshot info for remote destination -- too slow (for now).
 * better validation of bandwith limit options.
 * rsync-options -- don't include the essential ones (--relative)
   in the option, and put the user's ones first.
 * strip unnecessary quotes and spaces from string options.
 * improvements to spec alignment -- use partial periods
   if they have enough snapshots.
 * re-write compileSpecs to make it prettier and right
   with corresponding changes to findGoodPeriods etc.
