.PP
Brandysnap is (yet another) script that uses rsync to create snapshot backups of files and 
directories.
.PP
It is still being developed, and should be considered 'alpha' software.  
Use it at your own risk!
On the other hand, it's getting better: the author already uses it 'in production'.
.PP
It is designed to be flexible and robust.  In particular, it copes well with situations where 
snapshots are not created as regularly as they should be.  
This can be for a variety of reasons \*(-- hardware failure, operator failure, 
weekends, holidays, someone forgot to plug in the external \s-1USB\s0 drive...
.PP
Rather than assigning 'importance' to snapshots according to when they were made 
(for example, keeping Friday afternoon backups for longer than Tuesday morning ones), 
it looks at what snapshots exist and decides if any can be deleted.  
If the Friday afternoon backup is missing, it will keep the nearest one it can find.
.PP
The basic rule is 'backup first, ask questions later'.  Brandysnap assumes that snapshots 
are cheap \*(-- in both time and space.  In other words, making a snapshot is quick, and uses 
relatively little disk space because of the use of hard links.  (Of course the first 
snapshot is not cheap.  And snapshots over a network are never particularly quick.)
.PP
It therefore creates a new snapshot every time it is run, and then thinks about 
which snapshots, if any, are no longer required.
.PP
Brandysnap tries to cope with any situation.  Either the source or the destination can 
be on a remote computer (but not both at the same time).
.PP
Brandysnap is designed to be run regularly from cron (or similar automation system).  
It can also be run manually if required without upsetting things.
.PP
One of the features of brandysnap is that it uses rsync to do all the work, 
even for deleting old snapshots locally etc.  That means
that, if you need root access to create the snapshot maintaining 
ownership and permissions, the script only needs sudo access 
for rsync, not for any other command nor for the script itself.  
(e.g. use \fB\-\-rsync\-cmd = 'sudo rsync'\fR and \fB\-\-remote\-rsync\-cmd = 'sudo rsync'\fR to 
avoid the need for passwords [need more explanation here])
.PP
Brandysnap has been developed on Linux.  It is written in Perl and uses a selection of 
fairly standard modules (all available in Ubuntu repositories, and no doubt elsewhere too).  
It relies on hard links [see ...] and will only work properly when creating snapshots 
on a filing system that can handle hard links, such as ext3 or ext4 [and others...].
.PP
Lots of snapshots don't make a file more secure: if the file hasn't changed, and is the 
same in all snapshots, then it is only stored once on the disk.  If it gets corrupted 
for any reason, then it will be corrupted in all snapshots.  
(If the file is \s-1DELETED\s0 from one snapshot, it will still exist in the others, 
because of the way hard links work.) 
Think of the whole set of snapshots as one backup, with multiple versions of files that have changed.
.SS "Very Quick Start"
.IX Subsection "Very Quick Start"
See the \s-1README\s0 file for brief installation instructions.
.PP
If you want to try it out without reading further, create a configuration file 
called brandysnap\-test1.conf containing something like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& source      = /path/to/something/to/backup
\& destination = /path/to/writable/directory
\& template    = brandysnap\-test1
\& spec        = 4h1,1h1,1d7
.Ve
.PP
and then run
.PP
.Vb 1
\& brandysnap \-\-dry\-run \-\-conf brandysnap\-test1.conf
.Ve
.PP
The \fBdry-run\fR option will mean that nothing will actually be done.  
Once you're happy than the script won't break anything, try it without the \fBdry-run\fR.
.PP
For more options, run \fBbrandysnap \-\-help\fR.
.SS "Remote Sources and Destinations"
.IX Subsection "Remote Sources and Destinations"
Brandysnap assumes that any messing about with passwords has been taken care of.
.PP
In other words, it will call rsync on remote directories without supplying a password.
.PP
There are various ways of setting up rsync so that it doesn't prompt for a password \*(-- they are not described here.  [ a reference or two would be helpful here] So it's important to get the password-less access sorted out first.  In fact rsync may be run many times during one run of brandysnap, and rsync would prompt for a password each time.
.PP
If the remote side of the transfer is running \s-1SSH\s0 on a non-standard port, you'll find that there is no way to include the port in the location: \fBfred@example.com:/thingy\fR.  The work-around is to create an alias in \fB~/.ssh/config\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& Host eg2022
\&     HostName example.com
\&     Port 2022
.Ve
.PP
and then specify the location as \fBfred@eg2022:/thingy\fR.
.PP
Note that it's the user running rsync that needs to modify their \fB.ssh/config\fR file,
not necessarily the one who runs brandysnap.  If, for 
example you use \fB\-\-rsync='sudo rsync'\fR, then you'll need to edit \fB/root/.ssh/config\fR
rather than \fB~/.ssh/config\fR.
.PP
This does not apply when using an rsync daemon, in which case the port can be specified as part of the location, e.g. rsync://fred\e@example.com:1234/thingy.
.PP
Multiple destinations can be configured, in which case snapshots will be created on all 
destinations that are available.  
This can be used to put snapshots on several external \s-1USB\s0 drives in rotation, for example.  
Or you could specify one local and one remote destination for security.  
But note that multiple destinations won't always be in sync with each other: 
that's not the intention.  
Destinations will end up with different lists of snapshots if they are available at different times.
.SS "Preserving Ownership"
.IX Subsection "Preserving Ownership"
In order to preserve ownership of files, brandysnap needs to be run as root or via 'sudo'.
.PP
[More detail needed here re use of sudo and \fBremote-rsync-cmd = 'sudo rsync'\fR]
.SS "Keeping Snapshots"
.IX Subsection "Keeping Snapshots"
The number of snapshots that are made depends on how often brandysnap is run.  
It creates a new snapshot every time (usually).
.PP
What is more interesting is how many snapshots are \s-1KEPT\s0.  
This is determined by a series of specifications, or 'specs', such as
.PP
.Vb 1
\& 4d5,3w3,1d11
.Ve
.PP
which is a concise way of saying 'keep four snapshots a day from the last five days, 
then three a week for three weeks, then one a month for eleven months.  
If brandysnap has run successfully for the last year, then there will be at least 
4x5 + 3x3 + 1x11 = 40 snapshots.
.PP
Most of the tricky stuff in brandysnap is in deciding which snapshots to keep.
.PP
Each spec is of the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <frequency><period><count>
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <minimum frequency> \- <maximum frequency><period><count>
.Ve
.PP
The 'frequency' is the number of snapshots to be kept in each period.  
It can be a single number from 1 to...whatever is reasonable.  Or it can be a minimum-maximum range: for example \fI0\-4\fR means 'keep between 0 and 4 snapshots in this period'.
.PP
Note that the frequency is not the number of snapshots that will be \s-1CREATED\s0 \*(-- that is determined simply by how often brandysnap is run, and that will usually be down to the way that cron is configured.
.PP
The 'period' is a single letter indicating the time period.  It can be one of
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBh\fR \- hour
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBd\fR \- day
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBw\fR \- week
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBm\fR \- month
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBy\fR \- year
.PP
The period can be given in either upper or lower case.
.PP
The 'count' indicates the number of periods, as a number from 1 to as many as you like.
.PP
If the count is left out, the period is 'padded' to make up to the next period, working backwards in time from 'now'.  For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& 4d,2w4
.Ve
.PP
will be interpreted as \fB4d7,2w4\fR.  The 'day' specification is expanded to a week's worth of days to align with the next spec which is in weeks.
.PP
If the last spec has no count, it will be padded 'forever'.  The number of snapshots will only be limited by the available disk space.  And when the disk is full, the oldest snapshots will be deleted.
.PP
More spec examples:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB1d\fR \- just keep 1 backup every day, with no limit to the number of backups.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB1h24,4d6,3w3,4m11\fR \- one an hour for the first day, then 4 a day for the rest of the week then 3 a week for the rest of the month, then 4 a month to give a whole year of snapshots.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB0\-6d5,2\-5w3,4m12\fR \- keep up to 6 snapshots a day for five days, but consider days with no snapshots at all to be valid; then keep between 2 and 5 a week for three weeks, then keep snapshots for 12 months with 4 snapshots in each.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.PP
Snapshots also get deleted as time passes.  If a day with four snapshots gets to be old enough to fall within a \fB3w\fR spec, then the extra snapshots will be deleted.
.SS "Managing Snapshots Manually"
.IX Subsection "Managing Snapshots Manually"
Snapshots are stored on the destination, each in a separate directory
named \fItemplate-timestamp\fR.  For example,
.PP
.Vb 5
\& mightyboosh\-20120515\-100749
\& mightyboosh\-20120617\-145513
\& mightyboosh\-20120726\-145512
\& mightyboosh\-20120823\-145511
\& mightyboosh\-20120914\-145511
.Ve
.PP
Normally, you would leave the snapshots alone, allowing brandysnap to delete them
at the appropriate time.
.PP
If you wish to mark a snapshot as 'special', just rename it by adding some 
text to the end of the directory name.  Any text will do \*(-- make it something
meaningful.  For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& mightyboosh\-20120617\-145513\-before\-upgrade
.Ve
.PP
brandysnap will process the snapshot as usual, but will never delete it.  (In fact it will 
also tweak the priority calculations to make the 'special' snapshot more likely
to be kept.  In other words, any non-special snapshots in the same time period
are more likely to be chosen for deletion.)
.PP
There is no way to mark a snapshot as 
\&'unimportant, delete me first', but you can delete a 
snapshot manually if you want to.
.SS "Definition of 'snapshot' vs full/incremental backups"
.IX Subsection "Definition of 'snapshot' vs full/incremental backups"
Lots of snapshots don't make a file more secure: if the file hasn't changed, 
and is the same in all snapshots, 
then it is only stored once on the disk.  
If it gets corrupted for any reason, then it will be corrupted
in all snapshots.  
(If the file is \s-1DELETED\s0 from one snapshot, it will still exist in the others, because
of the way hard links work.)
.PP
Think of the whole set of snapshots as one backup, with multiple versions of files that have changed.
.SS "Email Notifications"
.IX Subsection "Email Notifications"
Email messages can be sent if brandysnap fails.  Emails are sent simply by piping them
to the 'sendmail' program, which is present on most Linux systems as part of the local
email server (exim, for example) and can be installed
in the Cygwin environment as part of exim.
.SS "Options"
.IX Subsection "Options"
All options can be given either on the command line or in the configuration file.  Command line options override configuration file ones (but see below regarding multiple options).  They are case-insensitive.
.PP
On the command line, options must be preceded by one or two hyphens, and can be abbreviated as long as they do not become ambiguous.  An 'equals' sign (\fB=\fR) is optional.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& brandysnap \-\-source xyz \-verbose=1 \-\-conf=bs1.conf \-nocal
.Ve
.PP
In the configuration file the hyphens are optional, but options can still be abbreviated.  Lines beginning with '#' are considered to be comments and are ignored.
.PP
Some options (such as \fBsource\fR and \fBdestination\fR) can be specified more than once.  In this case, command line options 
are added to configuration file one.  For example, if the configuration files includes \fBexclude foo\fR and \fBexclude bar\fR, and you put \fB\-\-exclude thing\fR on the command line, all three items (\fBfoo\fR, \fBbar\fR, and \fBthing\fR) will be excluded.
.PP
\&\fB~\fR can be used to specify local files and directories e.g.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \-\-logfile = ~/brandysnap.log
.Ve
.PP
The \fB~\fR will be expanded to the home directory of the user who _runs_ brandysnap.  
\&\fB~\fR can also be used on remote directories, e.g. \fBchris@example.com:~/documents\fR.  In this case, the \fB~\fR will be expanded by rsync to mean the home directory of the user specified (or implied) before the \fB@\fR symbol, in this case \fB/home/chris/\fR.
\&\fB~\fR can \s-1NOT\s0 be used in any of the \fBinclude\fR/\fBexclude\fR options.
.PP
\fIContexts\fR
.IX Subsection "Contexts"
.PP
For more complex set-ups, options in the configuration can be nested within 'contexts'.  
This allows options to made specific to a particular destination or source.
.PP
For example, this snippet from a configuration file:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& source /home/chris
\& destination /backups/one
\& <destination /backups/two/>
\&     source /home/ann
\&     exclude .cache
\& </destination>
\& source /home/fred
\& exclude tmp
.Ve
.PP
Contexts are begun with \f(CW\*(C`<destination dest\-name>\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<source source\-name>\*(C'\fR 
and finished with 
\&\f(CW\*(C`</destination>\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`</source>\*(C'\fR.
Each \f(CW\*(C`<...>\*(C'\fR must be on a line by itself.
.PP
Source contexts can be nested within destination contexts.
.PP
The example above has two destinations. \f(CW\*(C`/home/chris\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`/home/fred\*(C'\fR (excluding \f(CW\*(C`tmp\*(C'\fR from both) will be copied to \f(CW\*(C`/backups/one\*(C'\fR. 
\&\f(CW\*(C`/home/ann\*(C'\fR (excluding \f(CW\*(C`.cache\*(C'\fR) will be copied to \f(CW\*(C`/backups/two\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Only certain options are valid within each context.  A destination context can contain these options:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& hbest dbest wbest mbest ybest
\& safe calendar strict
\& source template spec
\& snapshot delete delete\-cp
\& weekstart
\& rsync\-cmd rsync\-opts rsync\-xopts remote\-rsync\-cmd
\& expire\-old
\& bwlimit\-in bwlimit\-out
\& compress restart
\& allow\-restart ldcount
\& all\-failed some\-failed
\& min\-interval
\& verbose loglevel debug
.Ve
.PP
A source context can contain these options:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& rsync\-cmd rsync\-opts rsync\-xopts remote\-rsync\-cmd
\& include include\-from exclude exclude\-from
\& bwlimit\-in bwlimit\-out
\& compress restart
\& allow\-restart 
\& min\-interval
\& verbose loglevel debug
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Options marked with '!' in the following list are required.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Options marked with '*' in the following list can be specified more than once.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.SS "Main options"
.IX Subsection "Main options"
.IP "\fBconfig \f(BIfile\fB\fR !" 4
.IX Item "config file !"
The name of a file to look in for further options.  
Configuration file options will be overridden by command-line ones, 
irrespective of where the \fBconfig\fR option appears on the command line.
.IP "\fBsource \f(BIfile/dir\fB\fR *!" 4
.IX Item "source file/dir *!"
A local or remote file or directory to add to the snapshot.  Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& source ~/Documents
\& source /home
\& source chris@example.com:~/Documents
.Ve
.Sp
More than one source can be specified, in which case each source will be rsync'd, 
one at a time, to each destination in turn.
.Sp
Sources can be given specific options with the following syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& <source ~/>
\&     exclude .cache
\& </source>
.Ve
.Sp
Rsync can not copy from a remote source to a remote destination, 
so any source/destination pairs which are both remote will be skipped.
.Sp
Each source must be readable by the user who runs brandysnap.
.Sp
If any files or directories within the source are not readable, brandysnap will carry on regardless.
.Sp
See the section on remote authorisation.
.Sp
By default, brandysnap uses the rsync options 
\&\fB\-\-hard\-links \-\-numeric\-ids \-\-archive \-\-one\-file\-system \-\-timeout=300\fR, 
so the whole of each source will be copied recursively without following symbolic links.  
See the \fBrsync-opts\fR and \fBrsync-xopts\fR options for ways to change this.
.IP "\fBdestination \f(BIdir\fB\fR *!" 4
.IX Item "destination dir *!"
A local or remote directory for use as the snapshot destination.  Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& destination /backups/
\& dest chris@example.com:/backups
.Ve
.Sp
More than one destination can be specified (see \fBsource\fR).
.Sp
Destinations can be given specific options (including sources) with the following syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& <destination chris@example.com:/backups>
\&     bwlimit\-out = 2000
\&     remote\-rsync\-cmd = sudo rsync
\& </destination>
.Ve
.Sp
Each destination must be writable by the user who runs brandysnap.
.Sp
See the section on remote authorisation.
.IP "\fBtemplate \f(BIname\fB\fR !" 4
.IX Item "template name !"
The directory name of each snapshot is of the form
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& <template>\-<timestamp>
.Ve
.Sp
See the [Snapshot Names section](#snapshotNames) for more details.
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& template docs
.Ve
.IP "\fBspecs \f(BIstring\fB\fR !" 4
.IX Item "specs string !"
The snapshot-keeping specifications.  See the Keeping Snapshots section for full details.
.IP "\fBlogfile \f(BIfile\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "logfile file"
The name of a file which will be used to log the output from brandysnap.  Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& logfile /var/log/brandysnap.log
\& logfile ~/bs\-docs.log
.Ve
.Sp
The user running brandysnap must have permission to create and write to the log file.
.SS "Tuning options"
.IX Subsection "Tuning options"
.IP "\fB[no]calendar\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]calendar"
In calendar mode, hours start on the hours, days start at midnight, weeks start on Sunday (but see the \fBweekstart\fR option), months start on the 1st of the month, years start on the 1st of January.  Padding is added where necessary to align periods with the calendar.  When calendar mode is turned off, periods are not aligned and are contiguous, ending 'now'.  See the [Calendar Mode section](#calendarMode) below for further details.  (default: \fBcalendar\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]safe\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]safe"
In safe mode, snapshots are only considered for deletion if the specified periods are 'complete' \*(-- i.e. they have the required number of snapshots.  If safe mode is turned off, all periods are considered complete, and extra snapshots in any of them will be deleted. See the [Safe Mode section](#safeMode) below for further details.  (default: \fBsafe\fR)
.Sp
The \fBxbest\fR options can be used to tune the snapshot-matching algorithm which decides which 
snapshots should be deleted.  The defaults assume that the latest snapshots within a period 
are the most valuable, and should be kept.  
Note these options only apply in calendar mode: in nocalendar mode, the oldest snapshot in a period
is always preferred (otherwise snapshots would never be kept long enough to be considered
by the next spec)
.IP "\fBhbest \f(BI0..59\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "hbest 0..59"
\&\fBhbest\fR determines the favoured minute within an hour for an hourly specification. For example, to prefer hourly snapshots created in the middle of an hours, use \fBhbest 30\fR.  (default: \fB59\fR)
.IP "\fBdbest \f(BI0..23.9\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "dbest 0..23.9"
Determines the favoured time within a day in hours.  For example, to prefer daily snapshots created at 5pm, use \fBdbest 17\fR. (default: \fB23.9\fR)
.IP "\fBwbest \f(BI1..7\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "wbest 1..7"
Determines the favoured day within a week, with 1=Sunday, 7=Saturday.  For example, to prefer weekly snapshots created on Friday, use \fBwbest 6\fR. (default: \fB1\fR)
.IP "\fBmbest \f(BI1..31\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "mbest 1..31"
Determines the favoured day within a month.  For example, to prefer monthly snapshots created at the beginning of the month, use \fBmbest 1\fR.  [This may be improved in the future to allow preferences such as 'the last Friday in the month'. If the value specified is greater than the number of days in a particular month, the last day of the month is used.  To always select the last day of the month, use \fBmbest 31\fR.  (default: \fB31\fR)
.IP "\fBybest \f(BI1..366\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ybest 1..366"
Determines the favoured day within a year.  In leap years, the value \fB366\fR is automatically changed to \fB365\fR, so \fB366\fR always means 'the last day of the year'. For example, to prefer yearly snapshots in the middle of the year, use \fBybest 180\fR. (default: \fB366\fR)
.IP "\fBmin-interval \f(BI0..\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-interval 0.."
Sets the minimum interval between snapshots, in minutes.  This is useful on a client, such as a laptop, that is
not running or not connected to the network all the time: cron can be used to schedule brandysnap frequently, and this option
used to make sure that snapshots are only created every hour, say.
.IP "\fBweekstart \f(BI1..7\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "weekstart 1..7"
Sets the first day of week.  If you consider that weeks start on Monday, use \fBweekstart 2\fR.  \fB1\fR=Sunday, \fB7\fR=Saturday.  (default: \fB1\fR)
.SS "Helpful options"
.IX Subsection "Helpful options"
.IP "\fBhelp\fR" 4
.IX Item "help"
Prints out a brief summary of options, and then stops.
.IP "\fBversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "version"
Prints out the brandysnap version number only and then stops.
.IP "\fBverbose \f(BI0..9\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "verbose 0..9"
This options sets the verbosity of the printed output, on a scale from \fB0\fR to \fB9\fR.  
Use higher values to see more about what brandysnap and rsync are doing.  
\&\fBverbose\fR can also be spelled \fBverbosity\fR (default: \fB3\fR)
.IP "\fBloglevel \f(BI0..9\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "loglevel 0..9"
Sets the verbosity level of output in the log file, on a scale from \fB0\fR to \fB9\fR.  
If no \fBlogfile\fR is defined, this option is effectively set to \fB0\fR.  (default: \fB3\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]dry\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]dry-run"
In \fBdry-run\fR mode, brandysnap goes through the motions, 
including checking options, sources, and destinations, as well as calling
rsync with its \-\-dry\-run option,
but doesn't actually create or delete any snapshots.  
The \fBdry-run\fR option is also passed through to rsync. \fBdry-run\fR can also be spelled \fBdryrun\fR.  
(default: \fBnodry-run\fR)
.SS "Rsync options"
.IX Subsection "Rsync options"
.IP "\fBrsync-cmd \f(BIpath\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "rsync-cmd path"
The location of the rsync programme on your system.  The default is just \fBrsync\fR which 
means brandysnap looks for rsync in your normal path. 
On some systems, you might need to set it to something else such as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& rsync\-cmd /usr/bin/rsync
.Ve
.Sp
(default: \fBrsync\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]compress\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]compress"
Enable rsync compression for remote transfers. Note that this only applies compression for transfer across the network: files are expanded again on the destination.  (default: \fBcompress\fR)
.Sp
Note that compression is used for any 'remote' transfer, i.e. when the source and destination are not on the same computer.  On a fast local network, you may want to use \fB\-\-nocompress\fR.
.IP "\fBinclude\fR/\fBinclude-from\fR/\fBexclude\fR/\fBexclude-from \f(BIpattern-or-file\fB\fR *" 4
.IX Item "include/include-from/exclude/exclude-from pattern-or-file *"
These four options are passed through to rsync unchecked and unchanged.  '~' is \s-1NOT\s0 expanded to a home directory.  See the rsync documentation for details.  (default: none)
.IP "\fBbwlimit-in\fR <n>" 4
.IX Item "bwlimit-in <n>"
Band-width limit for receiving in kbps.  Set it to 0 for no limit.  (default: \fB0\fR)
.IP "\fBbwlimit-out\fR <n>" 4
.IX Item "bwlimit-out <n>"
Band-width limit for sending in kbps. Set it to 0 for no limit.  (default: \fB0\fR)
.Sp
Tip: keep the value low (e.g. 200) if connecting over wifi to avoid swamping the connection.
.IP "\fBrsync-opts \f(BIoptions\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "rsync-opts options"
Options to pass to rsync, in addition to those that brandysnap will always use (i.e. \-\-relative and \-\-link\-dest). Use this only if you know what you are doing.  (default: \-aHx \-\-numeric\-ids)
.IP "\fBrsync-xopts \f(BIoptions\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "rsync-xopts options"
Extra options to pass to rsync.  This is a convenience option to all you to add to or override
the standard options without having to remember what the standard options are.  (default: none)
.SS "Email Options"

Just send a message to test the other email settings. Brandsysnap will not
do any other processing.  (default: no)
.SS "Advanced Options"
.IX Subsection "Advanced Options"
.IP "\fBall-failed \f(BIkeep/delete\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "all-failed keep/delete"
What to do with the snapshot if none of the sources are copied successfully.
\&\fB\f(BIkeep\fB\fR will keep the incomplete snapshot and mark it as 'partial' in the metadata file.
This means that it will not be considered as a proper snapshot when making future
decisions about which snapshots to get rid of.
If you specify \fB\f(BIdelete\fB\fR, the incomplete snapshot will be deleted immediately, in the expectation
that future snapshots will be more successful.
See also \fB\-\-some\-failed\fR.
(default: \fBdelete\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]delete\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]delete"
Delete no-longer-required snapshots.  If this option is turned off, brandysnap will create new snapshots but not delete any old ones. (default: \fBdelete\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]delete\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]delete-cp"
Include the 'current period' when considering which snapshots to delete.  See the description of [current period](#currentPeriod) below. (default: \fBdelete-cp\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]expire\-old\fR" 4

.IP "\fBldcount \f(BIn\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ldcount n"
Specify the number of previous snapshots that rsync will search looking for identical 
files to hard-link to.  
Normally the default value of \fB1\fR is ideal.  Set this value to \fB0\fR to turn off rsync's \fB\-\-link\-dest\fR option
completely, but be aware that this will greatly increase the size of the new snapshot, and the time
taken to create it (especially over the network).  Values greater than \fB1\fR can be used in conjunction
with [options yet to be implemented] to tune the behaviour of brandysnap. (default: \fB1\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]restart\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]restart"
If a previous run of brandysnap was interrupted for any reason, use this option to re-do the same snapshot (simply by relying on rsync's ability to not copy files that have not changed).  Any files in the source that have changed since the previous run _will_ be updated.  If more than one destination is being used, rsync will be run for _all_ destinations, even if some of them completed successfully before.
\&\fB\-\-restart\fR implies \fB\-\-snapshot\fR and \fB\-\-min\-interval=0\fR.  (default: \fBnorestart\fR)
.IP "\fB[no]snapshot\fR" 4
.IX Item "[no]snapshot"
Create a new snapshot.  If this option is turned off, no new snapshot will be created during this run of brandysnap but old snapshots may be deleted. (default: \fBsnapshot\fR)
.IP "\fBsome-failed \f(BIkeep/delete\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "some-failed keep/delete"
What to do with the snapshot if some of the sources are not copied successfully.  See \fB\-\-all\-failed\fR for details. (default: \fBkeep\fR)

.SH "FURTHER DETAILS"
.IX Header "FURTHER DETAILS"
.ie n .SS "<a name=""calendarMode"">Calendar mode</a>"
.el .SS "<a name=``calendarMode''>Calendar mode</a>"
.IX Subsection "<a name=calendarMode>Calendar mode</a>"
In 'calendar mode', which is the default, brandysnap works in terms of real weeks and months.  
Days always start at midnight, weeks at midnight on Sunday etc. (but see the \fB\-\-weekstart\fR option).
In non-calendar mode, the specs are interpreted more simply, 
working backwards from the moment when brandysnap is run.  
There will be no gap between periods: days and weeks can start at any time, 
depending on when the previous spec ran out.
.ie n .SS "<a name=""safeMode"">Safe mode</a>"
.el .SS "<a name=``safeMode''>Safe mode</a>"
.IX Subsection "<a name=safeMode>Safe mode</a>"
In 'safe mode', which the default, specs will only match against the list of existing snapshots if there are enough snapshots to satisfy the spec's definition.  Incomplete specs will be skipped.  This has the result that brandysnap is less likely to delete snapshots.  This is designed to cater for situations when brandysnap has not run successfully as often as it should have, for whatever reason.  For example, because of weekends or holidays, or because the destination wasn't available because an external \s-1USB\s0 drive wasn't connected (or two or more \s-1USB\s0 drives are being used in rotation).  e.g if the spec is \fB4d5\fR, it's now Monday and brandysnap did not run at the weekend, then the days with fewer than 4 snapshots (i.e. Saturday and Sunday) will be skipped; counting the 5 days will start on Friday and work backwards from there.  Safe mode can be turned off via the \fB\-\-safe\fR option.
.SS "Strict mode"
.IX Subsection "Strict mode"
In 'strict mode', which is not the default, brandysnap will not run if there are minor problems with the specs.  Normally, it will display information about how it has interpreted the specs, and carry on.
.SS "Weeks and months and years"
.IX Subsection "Weeks and months and years"
The fact that months and years do not have whole or fixed numbers of 
weeks makes counting periods awkward.  Brandysnap deals with this by 
skipping over the extra days, and not deleting any of their snapshots.
.SS "Status report"
.IX Subsection "Status report"
Brandysnap displays a status report on all existing snapshots at the end of each run.
.PP
However, if the destination is on a remote computer, the status report does include details of the disk space used by each snapshot because of the process of retrieving that information is slow.
.PP
The full status report can be seen for remote destinations by running brandysnap with the \fB\-\-status\fR option in addition to the usual configuration.  And even then, can only display 'Real size', not 'Delete size', because rsync doesn't give information about the number of hard links.
.ie n .SS "<a name=""snapshotNames"">Snapshot names</a>"
.el .SS "<a name=``snapshotNames''>Snapshot names</a>"
.IX Subsection "<a name=snapshotNames>Snapshot names</a>"
Each snapshot is a separate directory within the destination, with a name of the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <template>\-<timestamp:YYYYMMDD\-hhmmss>
.Ve
.PP
where the 'template' is specified by the \-\-template option.  For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        bs1\-20110616\-121159
.Ve
.PP
That format is fixed \*(-- it is used to identify snapshots; any directory that doesn't match that pattern will be ignored.
.SS "Interrupt handling"
.IX Subsection "Interrupt handling"
Brandysnap is designed to be robust: if it receives an interrupt signal, for example if the computer
is shutting down, or the user has pressed ctrl-C, while rsync is running, it traps the signal and stops cleanly, 
deleting any partially completed snapshot if possible.
.SS "Other notes"
.IX Subsection "Other notes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Brandysnap ignores 'minor' errors from rsync, which includes errors regarding permissions.  So check the output to make sure
that there are no 'Permission denied' messages.  If there are, you may need to run brandysnap as root \*(-- see xxx.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "KNOWN ISSUES"
As of 28 November 2012 and version 0.2.9, the following issues and bugs are known.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Under certain circumstances, rsync can fail if the source 
contains files that are hard-linked together
and for which you do not have read permission.  This is fixed in rsync 3.0.9 and later.  You can get
round it by specifying \fB\-\-rsync\-opts\fR with the usual options but omitting \fB\-\-hard\-links\fR
at the cost of using more disk space.
